# This package is all about setting up a new rails server so you can get going with projects rapidly.
# It sets up RVM, ruby, rails, unicorn, nginx, and a postgresql DB to work with.

# On a newly setup Ubuntu 11 server, login as root and run:

apt-get update
apt-get install git-core

# You need to add ssh keys to github.  To do this, login to the server as the user that the script creates, and:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@youremail.com"

# Copy the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and add to account on github. Then

git clone git@github.com:jeffhaack/rails-server-setup.git
cd rails-server-setup

# Edit the setup files as necessary (setup files are provided to automate certain tasks, but see the different READMEs for specific instructions)
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
