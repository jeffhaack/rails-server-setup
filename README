This package is all about setting up a new rails server so you can get going with projects rapidly.
It sets up RVM, ruby, rails, unicorn, nginx, and a postgresql DB to work with.

On a newly setup Ubuntu server, login as root and run:

apt-get update
apt-get install git-core

You need to add ssh keys to github.  To do this, login to the server as the user that the script creates, and:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@youremail.com"

Copy the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and add to account on github. Then

git clone git@github.com:jeffhaack/rails-server-setup.git
cd rails-server-setup
# Edit the setup.sh file as necessary
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh



Then you can pull down a rails app in the /var/www directory by:

git clone url_of_github_project
