This package is all about setting up a new rails server so you can get going with projects rapidly.
It sets up RVM, ruby, rails, unicorn, nginx, and a postgresql DB to work with.

After running setup.sh, you need to add ssh keys to github in order to pull down private projects
that are hosted there.  To do this, login to the server as the user that the script creates, and:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@youremail.com"

Copy the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and add to account on github.

Then you can pull down a rails app in the /var/www directory by:

git clone url_of_github_project
